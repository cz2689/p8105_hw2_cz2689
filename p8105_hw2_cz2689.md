# Problem 1

## Data Import:

``` r
raw = read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() 

p1 = select(raw, line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude,
    route1:route11, entrance_type, entry, vending, ada) %>% 
    mutate(entry = recode(entry, YES = "TRUE", NO = "FALSE"),
         entry = as.logical(entry))
```

## Describe the data:

This data set is about NYC Transit data. So far, I have import the data
into R. And use `janitor::clean_names()` to clean up variables names.
And then I use `select()` to keep the columns that I want. And then I
covert the entry variable from character to logical variable. Now, this
data set has 19 columns and 1868 rows. It includes variables: ada,
entrance_type, entry, line, route1, route10, route11, route2, route3,
route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, station_latitude,
station_longitude, station_name, vending.These data looks tidy enough
but it can be better.

## Answer questions:

``` r
x = distinct(p1, line, station_name)
```

1.  There are 465 distinct stations.

# Problem 2

## Data Import:

Mr. Trash Wheel:

``` r
mrtw = read_excel("./data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N549") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = ceiling(sports_balls), 
         sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)) %>% 
  mutate(which = "mrtw")
```

Professor Trash Wheel:

``` r
proftw = read_excel("./data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                    sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:M96") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(which = "proftw")
```

Combine two data set:

``` r
tw = merge(mrtw, proftw, all = TRUE)
```

Two Trash Wheels data set were imported. And then combined into one data
set called `tw`. The final data set `tw` has 641observations. And it
includes variable: chip_bags, cigarette_butts, date, dumpster,
glass_bottles, grocery_bags, homes_powered, month, plastic_bottles,
polystyrene, sports_balls, volume_cubic_yards, weight_tons, which, year.
The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel 190.12
tons. The total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in
2020 is 856 tons.

# Problem 3

## Data Import and clean:

Clean the data in pols-month:

``` r
pols = read_csv(file = "./data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    separate(mon, c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
    mutate(month = month.abb[month]) %>% 
    mutate(president = ifelse(prez_dem == 0, "gop", "dem")) %>% 
    select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)
```

Clean the data in SNP:

``` r
snp = read_csv(file = "./data/snp.csv") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    separate(date, c("month", "day", "year"), convert = TRUE) %>%
    arrange(month) %>% 
    mutate(month = month.abb[month]) %>%
    mutate(year = ifelse(50 <= year & year <= 99, year + 1900, year + 2000)) %>%
    arrange(year) %>% 
    select(-day) %>% 
    relocate(year, month)
```

Clean the date in unemployment:

``` r
un = read_csv(file = "./data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    pivot_longer(jan:dec, names_to = "month", values_to = "percentage of unemployment") %>% 
    mutate(month = str_to_title(month))
```

Merging SNP into pols:

``` r
s1 = merge(snp, pols, all = TRUE)
```

Merging employment into result:

``` r
final = merge(un, s1, all = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(month = recode(month, Jan = "1", Feb = "2", Mar = "3", Apr = "4", 
                        May = "5", Jun = "6", Jul = "7", Aug = "8", Sep = "9", 
                        Oct = "10" ,Nov = "11", Dec = "12"), month = 
           as.integer(month)) %>% 
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.abb[month])
```

## Summary:

The data set `pols` is about the number of national politicians who are
democratic or republican at any given time. It has 822 rows and 9
columns. Variables include: gov_dem, gov_gop, month, president, rep_dem,
rep_gop, sen_dem, sen_gop, year. The year ranges is (1947, 2015).

The data set `snp` is about the Standard & Poor’s stock market index. It
has 787 rows and 3 columns. Variables include: close, month, year. The
year ranges is (1950, 2015).

The data set `un` is about the percentage of unemployment at any given
time. It has 816 rows and 3 columns. Variables include: month,
percentage of unemployment, year. The year ranges is (1948, 2015).

The result data set `final` is generated by merging all three data sets
mentioned above. We now have information on political parties of
president, stock market index, and unemployment in one single data set.
This data set has 828 rows and 11 columns. Variables include: close,
gov_dem, gov_gop, month, percentage of unemployment, president, rep_dem,
rep_gop, sen_dem, sen_gop, year. The year ranges is (1947, 2015).
